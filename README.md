## Description
The Adventure Quest Manager is a web application designed to help users create, manage, and track adventure quests in a fantasy world.
Users can easily add new quests with a title, description, and difficulty level, and they can mark quests as complete or delete them as needed.

## Features
- **Create Quests**: Users can input a title, description, and difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) for each quest.
- **Manage Quests**: Users can view a list of all created quests, with options to mark them as complete or delete them.
- **Dynamic User Interface**: The application updates the quest list dynamically without needing to refresh the page.
- **Status Tracking**: Each quest has a status that indicates whether it is incomplete or complete.



<hr>

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server
To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building
To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests
To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
